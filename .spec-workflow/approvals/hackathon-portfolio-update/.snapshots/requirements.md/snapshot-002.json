The hackathon brought together 200 builders worldwide and was sponsored by Base (Coinbase), Virtuals Protocol, Sogni AI, and AWS. This entry will highlight the user's leadership and event organization capabilities in the Web3/blockchain space.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis update aligns with the portfolio's purpose of showcasing the user's expertise and accomplishments in blockchain technology, Web3, and community building. It demonstrates leadership beyond just technical skills.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Portfolio Entry in index.html\n\n**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see the hackathon organization experience prominently displayed in the projects section, so that I can understand the user's leadership and event organization capabilities.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.

IF images are available for the hackathon THEN the system SHALL display them in a Bootstrap carousel matching existing project carousels\n\n### Requirement 2: Links and Buttons Consistency\n\n**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see consistent button and link styling, so that I have a seamless browsing experience.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the hackathon entry includes links THEN the system SHALL use pipe-separated text links format: `<a>Link 1</a> | <a>Link 2</a>` matching existing portfolio entries\n2. WHEN an external link (news article, event page) is included THEN the system SHALL open in a new tab using `target=\"_blank\"`\n3. IF a \"Learn More\" page exists THEN the system SHALL link to it using the same pattern as other projects (e.g., `hackathon.html`)\n\n### Requirement 3: News Article Reference\n\n**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to access the official news article about the hackathon, so that I can verify the accomplishment and learn more details.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.
